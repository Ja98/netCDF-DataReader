ncDataReader2 is a library of C functions to access data stored in netCDF files
using different interpolation and extrapolation methods. The aim of this library
is to provide access from simulation systems like Modelica to data sets like
weather data or measured time rows. As such systems usually require strictly
continuity of functions and their derivatives, smooth spline interpolation is
included.

ncDataReader2 is released under the terms of the LGPL v2.

folder.
